# iOS Bluetooth Controller for Mecanum Drive Battle Robot
## Features
### Dual-Joystick Mode (Lite)
This is an older version of the full app used for testing. 
Two joysticks control translation and rotation of the bot. 
There is a button ability bar that could be used for turning on/off weapons, killing power to the bot, etc. 
There is a mode switch button bar to switch between the modes which was in development (originally a joystick mode, gesture-based mode, and a hybrid mode combining both joystick and gesture mode).

### Written in SwiftUI using Xcode for MacOS
